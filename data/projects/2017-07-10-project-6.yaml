description: Worked on the team at UNLV helping predict student outcomes using machine learning and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/video.UzaWVuNjE60_AMjGA_NfnDfE2FGoIIFB.html). I helped verify data coming from the research team, as well as the logs coming out of the LMS system. Sitting next to Dr. Matt Bernacki and learing how statistics and access to data educational researchers had not accessed before, I witnessed the power of big data at work.
